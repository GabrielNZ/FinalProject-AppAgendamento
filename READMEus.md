### About the project

Before starting my university journey, I really wanted to apply everything I had learned in this 1 year of study into a big real project. **Here it is!**
After 3 months of daily programming, I present my first **Full Stack** project.

It consists of an application in which, through a dashboard, clients and providers can organize service scheduling, that is:
- Provider -> Creates service and weekly availability.
- Client -> Requests the scheduling of a service at an available time.

**More in-depth explanation below and in the demonstration video**

### ⚙️ Back end
- I believe I was able to apply my main knowledge (Backend) in a satisfactory way.
  
- The project logic was created by me; the use of AI was exclusively for code optimization and applying new knowledge:

> Ex:
> My JWT knowledge used in previous projects became outdated for this project,
> therefore, I used AI to update my knowledge.
- [How is the BackEnd structured?](./STRUCTUREbackendus.md)

### ✨ Front end
- I was not able to acquire enough knowledge to use a framework on the front-end yet, so I decided to apply only what I knew (HTML, CSS & JS).
- When analyzing the code, it is easy to notice the lack of organization and the use of simple and direct tools, however considering that I studied little in this area and my focus is on the back-end,
I consider it a great achievement that the code is functional.

Still without knowledge of a framework, I used fetch for REST requests and HTML manipulation with JS for the website.
